# _Dirigo-IoT_: A Method to Integrate IoT Data into Object-Centric Event Logs

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper **_Dirigo-IoT_: A Method to Integrate IoT Data into Object-Centric Event Logs**. In this work, we introduce **_Dirigo-IoT_**, 
a novel method that systematically identifies the interactions between IoT devices and business process events, and incorporates the relevant contextual information captured by IoT data into event logs.

## **Repository Structure** 
### 1. CargoPickup_IoT.sqlite: 
an IoT-enriched OCEL log that was generated following _Dirigo-IoT_, representing the IoT-enhanced cargo pickup process

### 2. Evaluation_Queries: 
includes example queries used to evaluate _Dirigo-IoT_
