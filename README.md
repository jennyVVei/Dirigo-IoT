# _Dirigo-IoT_: A Method to Integrate IoT Data into Object-Centric Event Logs

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper **_Dirigo-IoT_: A Method to Integrate IoT Data into Object-Centric Event Logs**. In this work, we introduce **_Dirigo-IoT_**, 
a novel method that systematically identifies the interactions between IoT devices and business process events, and incorporates the relevant contextual information captured by IoT data into event logs.
